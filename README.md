# The Gateway Project

This is a project to display publicly available information, such as traffic flow maps and traffic cameras, on monitors mounted in the engine bay. The system should only be active when the engine bay doors are open.


## Hardware

The project is being developed to run on a Raspberry Pi 4.

### Sensors

Currently developing with an Adafruit VL6180X.

### Other Stuff

Will be using a Sparkfun RGB LED breakout to assist with development.

## Software

This project is **IN DEVELOPMENT**

### Hardware Files

Code for each piece of hardware should be contained in a single file. Logic can run in another place.
